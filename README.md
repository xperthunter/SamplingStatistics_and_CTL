# SamplingStatistics and CTL
Collection of MatLab scripts for sampling different distributions, visualizing central limit theorem, and Bayes Rule. 

## Motivation
Teaching statistics and probability can be supplemented with coding exercises on how to sample from simple distributions. I developed these scripts in conjunction with a course I taught. We cover sampling, central limit theorem, and Bayes Rule.
